description: Install the Volcano Python SDK and authenticate a user from a Python application.
order: 1
---

Use `volcano-sdk-python` for authentication, database queries, storage, functions, logs, locks, and realtime events.
REST calls are synchronous and raise typed exceptions on failure.
Python 3.11 or later is required; CI tests Python 3.11 and 3.14.

## Install the published package

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install volcano-sdk-python
```

The [PyPI distribution](https://pypi.org/project/volcano-sdk-python/) is named `volcano-sdk-python`.
Import it as `volcano_sdk`.
The package includes type information for mypy and other PEP 561-compatible checkers.

## Sign in and read a profile

Create a project, enable [email and password authentication](/platform/authentication/configuring-auth-methods), and create a user with a confirmed email when your project requires confirmation.
Use that project's [anonymous key](/platform/authentication/security/anon-keys).
Set `VOLCANO_ANON_KEY`, `VOLCANO_USER_EMAIL`, and `VOLCANO_USER_PASSWORD` in your environment.
Set `VOLCANO_API_URL` only when using a different API endpoint, such as local mode.

Save this as `quickstart.py`:

```python
import os

from volcano_sdk import VolcanoClient

client = VolcanoClient(
    anon_key=os.environ["VOLCANO_ANON_KEY"],
    api_url=os.environ.get("VOLCANO_API_URL", "https://api.volcano.dev"),
)
session = client.auth.sign_in(
    email=os.environ["VOLCANO_USER_EMAIL"],
    password=os.environ["VOLCANO_USER_PASSWORD"],
)
try:
    user = client.auth.get_user()
    assert user.id == session.user_id
    print(f"Signed in as {user.email}")
finally:
    client.auth.sign_out()
```

Run it with `python quickstart.py`.
It signs in, fetches the server-validated profile, prints the user's email, revokes its refresh token, and clears the local session.
An invalid email or password raises `AuthenticationError`; failed network requests raise `TransportError`.
Both inherit from `VolcanoError` and are exported from `volcano_sdk`.

## Keep authentication scoped to one user

A client holds its current session in memory.
Use a separate client for each independent user session; do not share one mutable client across users in a web server.
`client.current_session` and `client.auth.get_session()` read the local immutable snapshot without a request.
Use `client.auth.get_user()` when you need a server-validated profile.
Successful profile operations update the cached user while preserving the current credentials.
If `get_user()`, `update_user()`, `convert_anonymous()`, or `confirm_email_change()` receives an HTTP 401 and the session has a usable refresh token, the client refreshes once and retries with the original request values.
These operations do not retry other HTTP failures or ambiguous network failures, and they never retry under a replacement session.

`sign_up()` returns an acknowledgement without signing in by default.
Pass `sign_in_when_allowed=True` to sign in only when the project does not require email confirmation.
To adopt an existing session, pass a `Session` containing its access token, refresh token, and user ID to `client.auth.set_session()`.
The SDK does not persist tokens for you.

For operations that require a [service key](/platform/authentication/security/service-keys), pass `service_key` to the constructor in trusted server code.
Keep service keys and user credentials out of source control and client applications.

## Use the rest of the API

The SDK repository contains [examples for every public facade](https://github.com/Kong/volcano-sdk-python#try-the-contract-facade), including database filters and mutations, resumable uploads, function invocation, log queries, lock guards, and realtime presence and database changes.
Realtime uses an asynchronous lifecycle; follow those examples to connect and disconnect its channels.

See [release notes](https://github.com/Kong/volcano-sdk-python/releases) for version changes and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Kong/volcano-sdk-python/issues) to report a problem.
Include the package version, Python version, and a minimal reproduction without credentials.

See [Distributed locks](./locks.md) for acquisition recovery, renewal, and fencing.
