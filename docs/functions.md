description: Invoke deployed Volcano functions from Python and inspect their response status, headers, and data.
order: 5
---

Invoke a deployed function by its name.
This example assumes a public function named `hello` that accepts a JSON object.
Grant the anonymous key the explicit `functions.invoke` permission; the default
authentication-only permissions do not allow invocation. See [anonymous keys](/platform/authentication/security/anon-keys).

```python
import os

from volcano_sdk import VolcanoClient

client = VolcanoClient(
    anon_key=os.environ["VOLCANO_ANON_KEY"],
    api_url=os.environ.get("VOLCANO_API_URL", "https://api.volcano.dev"),
)
result = client.functions.invoke("hello", {"name": "Ada"})
print(result.status)
print(result.data)
print(result.version)
```

The SDK resolves the function's invocation endpoint and caches it for the lifetime provided by Volcano. Repeated resolution of a missing name raises a new `NotFoundError` with the original message, status, and error code while the cached miss remains valid.
Allow outbound requests to the resolved function domain as well as the API host.
Deployments without a separate function domain use the API invocation endpoint.

## Choose the invocation identity

The SDK uses the current session's access token, including a supplied `access_token`, before a configured service key or anonymous key.
A rejected or unsupported session token does not fall back to a key. Use an end-user access token when the function requires a user identity.
Use the [quickstart](./README.md) to sign in before invoking a function that requires a user.
An invocation authorized only by the anonymous key has no user identity.

Supply `service_key` to the client constructor for trusted server operations that require it.
Use a separate client for each independent user session.

## Recover a rejected session

Function resolution and invocation recover from a platform HTTP 401 before dispatch:
the SDK refreshes the captured session and retries the rejected request once.
Concurrent calls share successful recovery. Replacing or signing out that session
prevents replay under another identity. The call preserves its original payload values.
A function's own response, HTTP 403, or a network failure never triggers this retry.
Anonymous and service keys do not refresh.

## Read the result

`FunctionResponse` is immutable and exposes `status`, `headers`, `version`, and `data`.
The payload sent to `invoke()` must be a JSON object; omitting it sends an empty object.
Response data can be a JSON object, array, scalar, text, or `None` for an empty body.
JSON arrays become immutable tuples, and invalid JSON is returned as text.

A function's own non-success response is returned as a result when Volcano confirms the function ran.
Check `result.status` to handle those application errors.
Non-success platform HTTP responses before dispatch raise typed SDK exceptions such as `NotFoundError` or `AuthenticationError`.

If a cached function identity no longer exists, the SDK resolves the name again and retries once only when the platform confirms no function was dispatched.
A function's own HTTP 404 does not trigger another invocation.
Network failures do not establish whether a function ran; do not blindly retry operations with side effects.

Invalid invocation arguments and malformed successful resolution responses can raise `ValueError` or `TypeError`.

## Start and follow a durable execution

A durable execution can run for up to 366 days. Starting one returns a handle instead of waiting for its result:

```python
handle = client.durable.start(
    "charge-order",
    {"order_id": "order-9"},
    execution_name="order-9",
)

owner_client = VolcanoClient(
    anon_key=os.environ["VOLCANO_ANON_KEY"],
    api_url=os.environ.get("VOLCANO_API_URL", "https://api.volcano.dev"),
    access_token=os.environ["VOLCANO_PLATFORM_TOKEN"],
)
execution = owner_client.durable.get(project_id, "charge-order", handle.id)
page = owner_client.durable.list(project_id, "charge-order", status="running")
owner_client.durable.stop(project_id, "charge-order", handle.id)
```

`start()` accepts the same active session, service key, or anonymous key as `functions.invoke()`. It is the only durable operation available to application credentials. An execution name makes a start idempotent.

`get()`, `list()`, and `stop()` are owner-scoped. Call them from a trusted backend with the project owner's platform user token. Auth-user sessions, anonymous keys, service keys, and project access tokens are not accepted. `stop()` returns after the stop request is accepted, so poll `get()` until `is_terminal` is true.

## Write a durable function

Use `volcano_sdk.durable_authoring` in a durable function running on `python3.13` or `python3.14`:

```python
from volcano_sdk.durable_authoring import durable


@durable
def handler(event, ctx):
    charge = ctx.step("charge", lambda scope: charge_card(event["order_id"]))
    ctx.wait("settle", "30s")
    return {"charge_id": charge["id"]}
```

Volcano records each context operation. Resumed executions replay recorded results instead of repeating completed work. Keep changing decisions inside `ctx.step()`. Use `ctx.wait_until()` to poll application state. Volcano does not expose externally completed callbacks.

## Run durable functions locally

Deploy and start the same handler through the local durable engine:

```bash
volcano start
volcano durable deploy --all
volcano durable start charge-order --input '{"order_id":"order-9"}'
```

Local waits resolve immediately by default while preserving checkpoint and replay behavior. Set `LOCAL_DURABLE_REAL_TIME=true` before `volcano start` when wait timing must match the deployed function. Local executions persist across `volcano stop` and `volcano start`.

Running a decorated handler directly in a Python process still needs the optional test runtime: `python -m pip install 'volcano-sdk-python[durable]'`.
